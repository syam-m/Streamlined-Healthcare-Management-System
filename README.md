# EHRS - A Streamlined Healthcare Management System

## Project Summary

Our primary focus is to enhance data handling and management within hospitals through the implementation of healthcare management systems. Leveraging a custom replicated dataset inspired by open-source datasets, our goal is to design and create the Streamlined Healthcare Management System, a database application that facilitates easy access to patient records, administrative activities, and patient care details to empower healthcare providers.

## Project Purpose

The adoption of Electronic Health Record Systems (EHRS) has been widespread in both inpatient and outpatient settings over the past decade (Virginio & Ricarte, 2015). However, EHRS has also brought unforeseen errors and other unanticipated consequences that can present safety risks. These issues range from data accuracy, standardization, data backup issues, data security, and authentication. Additionally, mid and small clinics often face problems with costly EHRS and need a reliable yet simple solution.

We intended to create our product to solve these issues and be compatible for future expansions and upgrades. Our product is a streamlined healthcare management system designed to provide services for mid & small-sized clinics and hospitals. These hospitals often don't have complete in-house lab services or test services, so they outsource these services, making our product appealing. The primary objectives include enhancing patient management, streamlining administrative processes, improving patient care efficiency, and laying the groundwork for data-driven insights. Our product fits the requirements of these clinics or hospitals and can be expandable based on future requirements.
